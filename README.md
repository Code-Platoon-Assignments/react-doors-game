# React: Doors Game

## Main Challenge
We've coded up a simple 'Choose a door' game using React. To play the game, a player must select a random door, and they win the game if they correctly choose the door that has a prize behind it (otherwise they lose). The code is written using functional-based components. Your task is to convert the following components into a class-based design:
- src/App.js
- src/components/Game.js
- src/components/Door.js

Once you convert these components, verify that all of the previous functionality of the game remains in tact!

## Stretch Challenge
There is one piece of functionality that we've not implemented that would be nice to have. Notice that you are able to still open the other doors, even after you make your first door guess. The result of the game remains the same (based on the first door that you opened), but it would be better if we prevented any of the other doors from being opened after the first guess is made. Can you figure out how to implement this desired functionality?
